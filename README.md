WIP.

Features to add:
- Test for domain registrar pages via page content and skip them.
- Add line to input length of fuzzing and prefix/suffix/bothfix (both at the same time)/prefix-then-suffix (do both separately) mode as CLI parameters.
- Some requests hang for too long, set a time limit for the requests.
